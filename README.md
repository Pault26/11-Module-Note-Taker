<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The purpose of this app is to give the user a quick and easy way to keep track of notes and tasks. For the class, this project was a test of our ability to build an app with node and express and having it run through Heroku. This app could easily be repurposed for a multitude of uses such as a day planner, a class note app, or any other system that requires you save and store personal data.
